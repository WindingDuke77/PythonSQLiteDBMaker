# Basic SQLite Database Creation

### How to use:

1. Open editme.py
2. Edit the `database` Object with how you want
3. Edit the `tables["example"]` Object to the table that you want in your database
4. Run the script

With those basic steps you should have a database and sql commands in the export folder depending on your settings.

You can add as many tables as you want, just use `tables["example"]` as a example.
